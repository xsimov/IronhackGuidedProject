#IRONHACK GUIDED PROJECT
##How to create a project using Ruby & Ruby on Rails in the backend and Javascript in the frontend. And of course, TDD.

###Short Introduction

This is a guided example to develop a simple app from scratch. It is planned to cover almost all the issues we learned at the Ironhack bootcamp.
